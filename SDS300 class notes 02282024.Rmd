IDH - intermediate disturbance hypothesis
- should be parabola (diversity of species on y and grazers on x)
  - x = grazers = causing disturbance 
  - we want to know grazer counts + algal diversity of species (# of unique species)
  - code example for grazer example in lab 2:
idh_plot_div_abun <- ggplot(gzcount_algdiv, aes(x = total_grazer_count, y = total_algal_diversity, color = factor(tidal_ht_cat_num))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Grazer Abundance", y = "Algal Diversity") +
  ggtitle("Algal Diversity in Response to Grazer Abundance") +
  theme_classic() + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(gzcount_algdiv$total_algal_diversity), 1))
