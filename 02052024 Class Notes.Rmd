X, Y numerical data: 
Scatterplot 
Geom_point() + geom_smooth (methods = “lm”) 
geom_smooth(method = "lm")  # Add smooth line with linear regression method
THEN line of code for analysis 
Slope + Y intercept 
R^2 (close to 1 = strong relationship) 
P-value 

Populations to compare: 
X = categorical
Y = response variable
BOXPLOT
Middle line = median 
ALSO mean if we have a norm distribution (bell curve) 
Box = middle 50% interquartile range 
Lines – up and down to farthest point that isn’t outliers 

Simplify: DOTPLOT  
Lines of means + dots of raw data around it
Center + spread
Group by n categories
Df2 <- df1 %?%
Group_by(n sample names) 
Summarize(…….) 
Analyze with anova or complicated linear model 

When graphing mean – need S.E. or S.D. or 95% CI 
95% CI is BEST then SE then SD
P-vaue of 0.05 = 83.5% CI
Need bootstrap to get this or have large n (sample size)
