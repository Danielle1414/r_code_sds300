Categories + numerical response variable [population]
ANOVA in R: aov(Y~X, data = df) [can add more variables]
  can do aov1 <- aov(Y~group, data = df) # EACH SAMPLE as a row + USE RAW DATA
  then do TukeyHSD(aov1) # TukeyHSD of the new dataframe 
TukeyHSD() 
  groups ABC + error bars [is there effect of group on Y]
  

Categorical + error bars: don't use barplots 

Boxplot 

Scatter plot of raw data WITH means + error [not always RAW data because it can be messy]

STATS: 
T-test only 2 groups

Numerical variables: 
  simple linear regression - use lm() 
  lm(y~x, data = df)
  can get R^2 + P + Y int + Slope
  
ALWAYS check code: 
head()
tail() 
str()
